## Abstract

Apparatus and methods for performing small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) at low (cryogenic) temperatures for determining the structure of and changes in the structure of proteins, DNA, RNA, and other biological molecules and biomolecular assemblies and structures. A cryogenic, small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) application sample holder, includes a sample cell including a base portion and at least two parallel walls disposed on the base, wherein the sample cell has a liquid volume capacity defined by the walls and the base portion of 0.001 to 10 microliters.
