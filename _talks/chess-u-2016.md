## Abstract

Enzymes use dynamic motions to coordinate multi-step reactions and regulate activity. Imaging these motions is a major challenge. I will describe recent progress using X-ray scattering from crystals (diffuse scattering) and solutions (SAXS / WAXS) to visualize the motions of enzymes. I will speculate about the future role of scattering methods in structural biology enabled by new technologies. Can "molecular movies" be made at synchrotrons? Will diffuse scattering replace Bragg diffraction for routine structure determination?
