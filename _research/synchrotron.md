Synchrotron X-ray sources are powerful tools for learning about nanoscale structure and dynamics. These particle accelerators create extremely bright X-rays that enable new kinds of experiments. I apply synchrotron X-rays to problems in biophysics and conbribute to the development of new methods. These methods include cryo-SAXS, anomalous SAXS, time-resolved SAXS, [X-ray diffuse scattering](/research/diffuse), and chromatography-coupled SAXS (see Further Reading, below).

I collect data at several synchrotron X-ray facilities, including the [Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS)](https://www.chess.cornell.edu/), the [Advanced Photon Source (APS)](https://www.aps.anl.gov/), and the [National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II)](https://www.bnl.gov/ps/).

I am active in the synchrotron user community, and have served on the [CHESS User Executive Committee](https://www.chess.cornell.edu/about/advisory-bodies) since 2016.

Here is a list of beamlines (experimental end stations) I've used:

{% capture G1_pub %} {% include beamline_pubs beamline = 'G1'%} {% endcapture %}
{% capture F1_pub %} {% include beamline_pubs beamline = 'F1'%} {% endcapture %}
{% capture C1_pub %} {% include beamline_pubs beamline = 'C1'%} {% endcapture %}
{% capture BioCAT_pub %} {% include beamline_pubs beamline = 'BioCAT'%} {% endcapture %}
{% capture NECAT_pub %} {% include beamline_pubs beamline = 'NECAT'%} {% endcapture %}
{% capture LiX_pub %} {% include beamline_pubs beamline = 'LiX'%} {% endcapture %}
