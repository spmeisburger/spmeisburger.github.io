As a biophysicist, I study the structure of large molecules important for life -- proteins, DNA, and RNA -- in order to learn how they perform complex tasks. <!--Such tasks often involve changes in molecular structure and interactions, and to observe these changes I use techniques based on X-ray scattering.--> I develop new methods that use the [X-rays generated by particle accelerators](/research/synchrotron) to image these molecules as they change shape and interact.

I am currently a postdoctoral research associate in [Nozomi Ando's lab](https://ando.chem.cornell.edu/) in Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Cornell University.<!-- (formerly in [Chemistry at Princeton](http://chemlabs.princeton.edu/ando/)). I did my PhD in Applied Physics at Cornell in [Lois Pollack's lab](https://pollack.research.engineering.cornell.edu/).-->

My research interests include protein allostery, enzyme dynamics, intrinsic disorder, and electrostatic effects on RNA and DNA structure.<!--To measure changes in structure, -->
